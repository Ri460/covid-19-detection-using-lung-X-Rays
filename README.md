# COVID-19 X-Ray Detection Website

A demonstration website that shows how deep learning models could be used to analyze chest X-rays for patterns associated with COVID-19. This project is for **educational purposes only** and does not provide actual medical diagnosis.

![COVID-19 X-Ray Detection Demo](https://i.imgur.com/JZkJ7vG.png)

## Features

- Upload and preview chest X-ray images
- Simulated AI analysis of X-ray images for COVID-19 patterns
- Interactive user interface with real-time feedback
- Educational information about AI in medical imaging
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **This is a demonstration website only. It does not provide actual COVID-19 detection or diagnosis. The analysis shown is simulated and should not be used for medical purposes. Always consult with healthcare professionals for proper testing and diagnosis.**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-xray-detection.git
cd covid-xray-detection
```

2. Install the required dependencies:


```shellscript
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:


```shellscript
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:


```plaintext
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

3. Upload an X-ray image using the interface
4. Click "Analyze X-Ray" to see the simulated analysis results

```

## How It Works

1. **Frontend**: The user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive way to upload and analyze X-ray images.
2. **Backend**: A Flask server handles file uploads and processes X-ray images.
3. **Analysis Process**:

1. User uploads an X-ray image
2. Image is sent to the server for processing
3. Server simulates analysis (in a real implementation, this would run the image through a trained model)
4. Results are returned and displayed to the user



4. **Simulated Model**: For demonstration purposes, the application uses a simulated model that generates random predictions. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual trained deep learning model.


## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Image Processing**: Pillow, NumPy
- **UI Design**: Custom CSS with responsive design


## Limitations

This demonstration has several important limitations:

- The analysis is simulated and does not use an actual trained model
- X-ray findings for COVID-19 can be similar to other respiratory conditions
- AI systems cannot replace proper medical testing for COVID-19
- Medical diagnosis should always be performed by qualified healthcare professionals
- PCR and antigen tests remain the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis


## Potential Future Improvements

- Integration with an actual trained deep learning model
- Visualization of regions of interest in the X-ray using techniques like Grad-CAM
- User accounts and history tracking
- Comparison with multiple AI models
- Integration with medical record systems
